-----------------

Contains a list of white-space separated coordinates specifying the position
 of each node in the blob. The file starts with a header of four lines, and 
 is followed by two separated lists with the interior and exterior nodes:

Topology file: .top   {#iftop}
-------------------

Contains a list a white-space separated indices specifying the node indices
contained within each element. There are ten indices per element as they are second
order elements (every tetrahedron has a node at each corner 
 and at the midpoint of each edge). Separated into internal (no surface faces) 
 and external (surface faces) elements for use in surface-surface interactions.

Van der Waals file: .vdw    {#ifvdw}
-------------------------
Contains a list of integers, ranging from -1 to 6, describing the type of vdw interaction
 this face will undergo, as described by the Lennard-Jones files, where:
   * -1 - stands for inactive faces.
   * 0 to 6 - specifies the type of an active face, interacting 
              with parameters defined in .lj file.

Lennard-Jones file: .lj    {#iflj}
-----------------------

Contains a matrix of parameter pairs for the Lennard-Jones interactions 
 between the different face types specified in the .vdw file. 
 A description of this file can be found in the [Lennard-Jones](\ref ljPotential) section. 

<!-- In the following example:


    ffea vdw forcefield params file
    num vdw face types 7

face type0 interacts with face type0 through a Lennard-Jones potential
 that has a well depth of \f$\epsilon_{0,0} = 10^{15} J/m^2\f$ and an 
 equilibrium distance \f$\sigma_{0,0} = 10^{-9} m\f$, 
 whereas face type 0 interacts with face type 1 
 (and in fact, all other interaction types) with a Lennard-Jones potential
 with parameters \f$\epsilon_{0,1} = 10^{12} J/m^2\f$ and 
  \f$\sigma_{0,1} = 10^{-9} m\f$. Therefore, this matrix should be symmetric. 
--> 


Pre-computed potentials: .pot and .force  {#potfile}
----------------------------------------
These files contain values for the potential and force in a two column format:


    0 1606.41515966667
    0.002 1595.931897
    0.004 1580.257003
    0.006 1564.662109


where the first column give positions and the second column has energies and forces
 respectively. The runner input file will expect a conversion factor to \f$m\f$ and 
 \f$J\f$ (and \f$Jm\f$) for them (see the [pre-computed potentials](\ref fm_inputfile)
 for more details). 


Springs file: .springs   {#ifsprings}
----------------------

This file contains a set of Hookean springs joining pairs of nodes to allow the addition of arbitrary interactions, if necessary.
 After an introductory header, every line specifies the details of a single spring through:
 spring constant (in ` N/m `), equilibrium distance (in meters)
 blob i, blob j, conformation k, conformation l, node m, node n. 
Specifically, a springs file with 3 springs could look like:


    ffea springs file
    num_springs 3
    springs:
    1e-2 5e-9 0 1 0 0 40 40
    1e-2 5e-9 0 1 0 0 57 57
    1e-2 3e-9 0 1 0 0 66 83


Springs file: .pin   {#ifpin}
----------------------

This file provides a list of nodes for the corresponding blob that will remain fixed 
 in its initial position. The format for a valid ` .pin ` file with three nodes pinned would be:


    ffea pinned nodes file
    num_pinned_nodes 0
    pinned nodes:
    56
    59
    445


Checkpoint file .fcp {#ffeaCheckpointFileIn}
----------------------------------------------
This is the same type of file than the output [checkpoint file](\ref ffeaCheckpointFileOut). 


States file .states {#ffeaStatesFileIn}
-----------

This file contains data regarding the kinetic states that can be activated within this blob.
 Each state is defined through two consecutive lines. Line 1 defines the conformation index
 active in this state. Line 2 defines any binding site couplings:


    ffea kinetic states file
    num_states 2
    states:
    conformation_index 0
    binding
    conformation_index 1
    binding


Rates file .rates {#ffeaRatesFileIn}
----------

This file defines the rates (units - Hz) of kinetic switching between states. It is formatted as a matrix,
 num_states X num_states where rows are the base state, and columns are the target state:


    ffea kinetic rates file
    num_states 2
    rates:
    0 1e10
    1e9 0

These rates are converted into switching probability / timestep within the code, 
 so if your rate asks for a higher than 100% probability of
 switching at each timestep, FFEArunner will return an error. The identity rates (leading diagonal) are actually not used
 by the FFEArunner; because the sum of probabilities in each row must equal 1, the code calculates this value using all of the others.

Map file: .map {#ffeaMapFileIn}
--------------

This file defines the linear map (matrix) between nodes of different conformations. Due to the size and sparsity, this matrix
 is written in the Yale Sparse matrix format. Below is the matrix defining the transformation of a cube onto itself (identity matrix):


    FFEA Kinetic Conformation Mapping File (Sparse)
    num_nodes_from 8
    num_nodes_to 8
    num_entries 8
    map:
    entries - 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    key - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    columns - 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

Note: This map should not be calculated manually! FFEAtools provides a [tool](\ref kffea_implementation) to help with the
 automation of this process.

Output files {#oFiles}
======================

Trajectory file: .ftj    {#oftrajectory}
---------------------
Contains a list of `*` separated frames specifying the structure of the blob at
each outputted time-step. The frames contain a list of blobs which themselves
contain a list of node positions, velocities and forces. If the motion state is
STATIC, blob does not move, so frame is not outputted to save space, and improve 
the performance. Only the positions are used in the viewer.
 In between each frame is a small segment showing whether any conformational 
 changes have occurred. As such,
each frame can be a different length, which is why the blob and conformation
sizes are specified at the beginning of the file.

Measurement files: .fm / .fdm   {#ofmeasurement}
------------------------
 
Contains a list of the relevant system properties of each outputted time-step.
Two separate types of file for internal and external measurements.


### Global measurements: .fm ### 

Every simulation will print this file, which contains measurements of the entire
system. Internal properties such as strain and kinetic energies, Centroids, Angular momentum, RMSD etc
are included, as well as the total interaction energies within the system from VdW, springs and Precomp potentials.
Additionally, system details and a copy of the total input parameter set are written to this file.
 The format is:


	FFEA Global Measurement File

	Simulation Details:
		Simulation Began on DD/MM/YYYY at hh:mm:ss
		Script Filename = /path/to/script/script.ffea
		Simulation Type = Full

	Parameters:
		restart = 0
		dt = 1.000000e-14
		...

	Measurements:
	Time          StrainEnergy  Centroid.x    Centroid.y    Centroid.z    RMSD

	...


A small thing to note; if mass is not included, momenta and kinetic energies are not written. If VdW is not active, it is not written. Anything optional may not be written,
as seen here with KineticEnergy, SpringEnergy, VdWEnergy and PreCompEnergy.
This is to avoid writing out many zeroes, gain some performance and save disk space.
The [FFEA toolkit](\ref FFEAanalysistut) is equipped to read in these files in general.

### Detailed measurements: .fdm ### 

This file records the measurements on individual blobs, and between each specific pair of blobs. It is created by default but can be suppressed with '-d' and the command line.
and allows one to know specific details about individual molecules / pairs of molecules in a multi-blob simulation. Measurements specific to each blob are printed first, followed by each interacting pair.
 The format is:


	FFEA Detailed Measurement File

	Measurements:
	Time          | B0 StrainEnergy  Centroid.x    Centroid.y    Centroid.z    RMSD          | B1 StrainEnergy  Centroid.x    Centroid.y    Centroid.z    RMSD          | B0B1 SpringEnergy  VdWEnergy

	...


Again, if something is not include, it's associated column is not written. So here, Blob 0 had no mass but Blob 1 did. Additionally, 2 interaction types were included between blobs 0 and 1 but VdW is currently out of range,
hence the zeroes. No blobs were interacting with themselves.

Checkpoint file .fcp {#ffeaCheckpointFileOut}
------------------------------------------------
The checkpoint file stores the state of the Random Number Generator(s) RNG(s) at the 
 last saved step. The format of this file, that should be automatically written,
 starts with a single header line specifying the number of RNGStreams dedicated to 
 the thermal stress:

     RNGStreams dedicated to the thermal stress: <N>

then it follows ` <N> ` lines with 6 integers per line specifying the state of the
  stream, e. g.:

     1828815773 2063911640 1007531883 4278127031 1691073935 2862951708


Afterwards, in the case of using kinetics, the following line will be found:

    RNGStream dedicated to the thermal stress:\n

followed by a single line with 6 integers describing the state of 
   the RNGStream dedicated to the kinetic stress.
